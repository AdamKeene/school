flexible models in parametric approaches fit many functional forms but require estimating more parameters leading to overfitting ie following noise too closely
non-parametric is cool because no explicit assumptions but requries more observations for accurate estimates
restrictive models are more interpretable for inference, easier to distinguish the relationship of fewer variables
sometimes we only care about prediction not interpretability, inflexible might still be better bc overfitting though

The colon (:) is used to indicate an interaction between two or more variables in model formula. The asterisk (*) is use to indicate all main effects and interactions among the variables that it joins. 

look up confidence vs prediction interval, r squared, p value

poly() is orthogonal polynomials, does the Y = β0 + β1X + β2X2 + β3X3 + ϵ formula by default
