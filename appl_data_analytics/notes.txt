flexible models in parametric approaches fit many functional forms but require estimating more parameters leading to overfitting ie following noise too closely
non-parametric is cool because no explicit assumptions but requries more observations for accurate estimates
restrictive models are more interpretable for inference, easier to distinguish the relationship of fewer variables
sometimes we only care about prediction not interpretability, inflexible might still be better bc overfitting though

confidence vs prediction interval
r squared, p value
