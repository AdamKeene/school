assignment 1:
assignment 2: 
doubling size is faster bc remains O(1) instead of O(n), as it continues to grow the size continues to grow as well, also memory allocation
assignment 3:
MAD method multiply add divide: compression method which helps avoild collisions
polynomial hash: 128 is arbitrary but power of 2 is efficient

sorting:
radix sort: faster when range is limited compared to n
